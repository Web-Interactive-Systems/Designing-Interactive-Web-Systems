# Designing Web Apps
# A brief history of the web

The web as we know it today, has come a long way.

In 1960s the network ARPANET, a US military project, featured TCP/IP communicaton protocol.

Later, in 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee (TimBL for short), while working at CERN, he wrote a system called ENQUIRE to keep track of complex projects, softwares, and teams working at CERN. ENQUIRE featured the first hypertext system (node-link architecture).

ENQUIRE: Like a **wiki**, bidirectional hyperlinks, direct editing of the server (CMS)

In 1989, TimBL building on his experience with ENQUIRE, created the building blocks of the web as we know it:

*   HTTP,
*   HTML, the first web browser — (called WorldWideWeb),
*   HTTP server,
*   A few web pages (e.g., CERN telephones page).
*   An integrated editor to write HTML

In 1994, TimBL founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Since than the web has exploded. Other technologies followed, in particular, CSS and Javascript.

# Web open standards

The web as we know and use today, would not have been possible without open standards that maintain how everything on the web work together. Most totably:

*   **W3C**: Web standards
*   **WHATWG**: HTML standards
*   **ECMA**: ECMAscript standard, on which javascript is based
*   **Khronos**: Standards for 3D graphics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning, computer vision, and parallel computing

# From reading things to doing things

*   Early on, the web was for reading things.
*   Now, is more for doing things.
*   The cornerstone of the popularity of the Web is ***Javascript***.

# Importance of JavaScript

Currently,

> **JavaScript is used as a client-side programming language by 98.8%** of all websites.

Without Javascript, the web would have remained static interconnected pages. Javascript brought

*   interactivity to the web
*   modularity to the ecosystem

Developers around the world are developing programs (aka. libraries, packages) for various needs and problems and made them available to others.

# The web is not easy

> *The only constant for the web is change*

*   The web ecosystem is evolving daily.
*   And there is an increasing demand for highly dynamic and interactive platforms and apps.
*   Designing these types of apps can be challenging and complex.
*   The good news is that there are a number of modern **frameworks** to help speed up the process of web development.
