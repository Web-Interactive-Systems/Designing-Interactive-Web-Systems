# Designing Authoring Tools
These are types of tools that allow non-expert users to author (create) content and artifacts without the need to write code (programming). This approach is also known as end-user programming.

There are four types of end-user programming

*   Scripting (e.g., Unity engine scripting)
*   Visual programming (e.g., MIXAP, Unreal engine blueprint )
*   Programming by demonstration
*   Sloppy programming or natural language programming (e.g., ChatGPT)
