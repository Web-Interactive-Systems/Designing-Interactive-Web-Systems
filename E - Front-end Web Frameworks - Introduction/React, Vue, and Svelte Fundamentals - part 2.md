# React, Vue, and Svelte Fundamentals - part 2
## Managing an app

Each toolchain will offer ways to manage the development of an app. This includes:

*   scaffolding an app as we just did using Vite, but also
*   installing dependencies, starting a dev server,
*   customizing the build pipeline (e.g., using plugins), and
*   building an optimized bundle of the app

Often we manage apps through scripts that a package manager can run for us. Most toolchains provide a set of scripts to perform various tasks when developing an app. Also,

*   We can create our own scripts.
*   Scripts can integrate with package managers in the scripts section in the package.json.
