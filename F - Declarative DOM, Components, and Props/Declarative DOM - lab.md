# Declarative DOM - lab
To appreciate the power of declarative DOM, we will create/use our declarative DOM library in this first lab that mimics some of the React APIs. Letâ€™s call it Mini.

*   Clone the git repo: [Link for GitHub classroom provided in the class].
*   The repo has a set of lab files.
*   Each lab has a set of small programming problems.
*   Follow the instructions provided in each lab file to complete the lab.

Don't be wary if you don't understand all the code.

Just follow the instructions in the lab files.

We will explain some advanced concepts as we progress in the course.
