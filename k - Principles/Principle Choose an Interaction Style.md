# Principle Choose an Interaction Style
Once we know our users and their tasks, we can tackle the interaction style we want to offer them. And, there are five interaction styles to consider.

:ref[Principle Direct Manipulation]{path='/notes'}

:ref[Principle Fluid Navigation and Menu Selection]{path='/notes'}

:ref[Principle Form Fill-in]{path='/notes'}

:ref[principle command language]{path='/notes'}

:ref[principle command language]{path='/notes'}

Interaction styles allow the user to design a consistent interface that minimizes the learning curve for users and enables them to become productive with the interface quickly.

Usually we blend many styles: for example, on Amazon, a form fill-in interface for shopping. Checkout offers menus for items, such as accepted credit cards. A direct manipulation allows users to click on products to explore options. Menus allow exploring color choices. Also, keyboard commands can provide shortcuts for search, etc.
