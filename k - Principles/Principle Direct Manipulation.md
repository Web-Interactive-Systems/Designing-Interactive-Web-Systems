# Principle Direct Manipulation
Designers create visual representations of the familiar objects of action.

For example, the desktop metaphor, drawing tools, photo editing, games

WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)

users directly interact with objects (e.g., a drawing, a photo, a folder, or a file) to perform specific actions (e.g., renaming, moving, etc.)

1.  continuous representations of the objects and actions of interest with visual metaphor
2.  direct actions execution (e.g., using buttons) instead of complex syntax
3.  rapid, incremental reversible actions (undo/redo)

## Strength or transactional distance

*   Weak: mouse, trackpad, joystick, or buttons, translating users’ physical actions into a digital space (e.g., screen)
*   Medium: The user interacts directly with the digital space (e.g., screen) using natural gestures, such as touches, moves, grabs, and pinches. It is still limited by the screen.
*   Strong: The user interacts directly using natural gestures to perform actions without intermediary objects, for example using gesture recognition.
*   Immersive: The user is inside a virtual space controlling the scene directly.

## Pros

Novices can learn basic functionality quickly

Retention,

Experts can work rapidly to carry out complex tasks, even defining new functions and features

Avoids errors

Error messages are rarely needed

Users can immediately see whether their actions are furthering their goals, and if the actions are counterproductive, they can simply change the direction of their activity

Users experience less anxiety because the interface is comprehensible and because actions can be reversed easily

Users gain a sense of confidence and mastery because they are the initiators of action, they feel in control, and they can predict the interface’s responses

Encourage exploration

Affords high subjective satisfaction

## Cons

Harder development

Harder for small screens (e.g., mobile)

Harder accessibility

Faster perception/action loop (less than 100 ms) but slower computational runtime (undo/redo with database)

Consume more space on the screen

Requires good visual representations and metaphors

Experienced users and typists might prefer command manipulation

## Examples

*   Google maps
*   Video games
