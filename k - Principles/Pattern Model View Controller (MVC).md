# Pattern Model View Controller (MVC)
An architectural pattern that governs information flow in user interfaces.

*   Model: state (e.g., a text of an input text)
*   View: display of state (e.g., a form, input field)
*   Controller: handler that updates the model and the view (e.g., when the user fill in text in an input).
