# IU Design Systems
Design systems are a set of design principles, patterns, components, design tokens, themes, templates, and utilities to make it easier to build unified, consistent, accessible, mobile-friendly apps. Unified broadly means apps that look and feel uniform. Consistent broadly means apps that behave normally and predictably in different contexts of use (e.g., browsers).

Remember that building :u[unified], :u[consistent], :u[accessible], and :u[mobile-friendly] **is hard**. Design Systems solves these issues for the developers. The developers can focus more on the added value of their apps.

There are many design systems. Here is a small list:

*   Radix UI: <https://www.radix-ui.com/>
*   Material design: <https://m3.material.io/>
*   Ant Design: <https://ant.design/>
*   Material UI: <https://mui.com/material-ui/>
*   Joy UI: <https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/>
*   Headless UI: <https://headlessui.com/>

In our projects, we will use mainly Radix UI.
