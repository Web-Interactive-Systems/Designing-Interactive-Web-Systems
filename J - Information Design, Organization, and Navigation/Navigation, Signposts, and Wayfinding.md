# Navigation, Signposts, and Wayfinding
> Allow users to locate themselves, where there are now where to go next.

Allow the users to understand the information space they are in.

## Signposts

*   Features that help users understand immediate surroundings (titles, logos, branding devices, headers, progress indicator, breadcrumbs, annotated scroll bar)

## Navigation

*   Global navigation: e.g., top navbar
*   Utility navigation: links and tools related to non-content aspects
*   Associative and inline navigation: content and contextual links (e.g., related content, tags)

**Consideration for navigation design**

*   cognitive load
*   short distance
*   brings steps together
*   breath over depth (more selections at top-level options)
*   frequently used items directly in the global navigation
