# UI Design Patterns
*   Items, search, and browse: Find desired items from a long list. Important design principles of content-centric websites (e.g., Google, YouTube, or newspapers). Similarly important for some task-centric websites (e.g., booking systems, flights, hotels, uber, etc.)
*   Instant value: The first screen presents actionable information without requiring input or actions from the user. Provide instant value to the user.
*   Smart defaults: Make smart assumptions about display parameters needed.
*   Streams and feeds: a continuously updated series of contents and feeds (e.g., news, social, streams like video and others)
*   Thumbnail grid: a grid of objects to browse and select from. Browse a collection of objects, view a single object
*   Dashboard: Displays key points in a single information-dense page
*   Canvas + palette: A large blank area (central workspace) with a set of tools or palettes (e.g., Figma). Often it allows users to create and edit content.
*   Wizard: A series of screens that guide a user in incrementally performing a task (e.g., steps components, step-by-step). Often the user navigates the Wizard using Previous and Next buttons.
*   Settings editor: An easy-to-find, self-contained page or window where the user can change or view the settings (e.g., profile page, etc.)
*   Alternative Views: views or methods of visualizing information in a system or an app that are substantially different from one another but offer access to the same information. This supports usersâ€™ preferences and gives users different lenses (e.g., grid, list, and map combined)
*   Many workspaces: an interface that allows user to view more than one page, project, file, or context at a time (tabbed view, columns, or split-views)
*   Help systems: an interface that shows how to use the interface (inline, tooltip, help pages, guided tours, knowledge-base e.g., quora-style)
*   Tags: common method of classifying and categorizing content. They help search and browse items too.
