# Design Layout
particular ways of arranging things in space. A layout has three basics

## Visual hierarchy

Ways of emphasizing importance to elements, most important, least important, and so on. The goal is to help the user deduce the structural importance of elements.

## Design elements for importance

*   size: headline, subheadline
*   Position: place in space, top is important
*   Density: tightly space between elements
*   Background: shade color will draw attention
*   Rhythm: multiple elements (e.g., lists, grids), unity (e.g., space, alternation), balance, etc.

## Gestalt principles

A set of rules predicting how humans perceive visual objects from a scene.

## Visual Flow

Deals with the tracks that readers’ eyes tend to follow when scanning pages. One aim is to sequence users’ attention from most important to important to least important information. Set up focal points to attract user attention to important information. Use implied lines to create visual flow.

## Implied lines

Implied lines are implicit lines created using visual elements such as colors, shadows, textures, and spaces. Their aim is to guide user’ attention or emphesize certain elements.

## Dynamics displays

### scroll bars

common way of presenting small viewport onto a large thing, such as text, an image, canvas, or a table

### responsive enabling

enable and disable functionalities depending on user needs and contexts.

### progressive disclosure

an interaction design pattern that sequences information and actions across several screens (e.g., step by step navigation model)

### UI regions

*   header / window title
*   menu or navigation
*   main content area
*   footer
*   panel

## Patterns

### visual framework

Shared characteristics to maintain a consistent layout and style

### center stage

The most important content is placed at the center of the screen (e.g., google docs, powerpoint, etc.). This type of layout is common for task-based apps.

### grid of equals

arrange content items into a grid or matrix.

### titled sections

Segment content into well-defined and named sections

### module tabs

### accordion

### collapsible

### movable
