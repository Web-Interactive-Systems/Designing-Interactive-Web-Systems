# Golden Rules of Interface Design
*   **Consistency**: actions, views, terminology, prompts, menus, helps, colors, layouts, fonts, capitalization (see 3.4.3 Consistency theories)
*   **Universal usability**: designs that support diverse user needs and uses
*   **Plasticity**: designs that support transformations of content depending on user needs and uses
*   **Feedback**: every action needs feedback, be it implicit or explicit
*   **Dialogs to yield closure**: Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end.
*   **Error resilience**: prevent errors, allow users to recover quickly from errors
*   **Reversible actions**: allow user to undo/redo their actions
*   **User control**: keep the user in control of the interface, give them sens
*   **Offloading**: reduce short-term memory
*   **Scaffolding**: Segment and group usersâ€™ actions into small sequenced closures
