# Golden Consideration for UI
*   Safe exploration: let user explore an interface and not suffer bad consequences. It is likely they that will learn more and feel more positive about the interface (obvious entry points).
*   Instant gratification: let user see immediate resuls of their actions. Provide value to users first before asking for valuable things.
*   Satisficing: user will pick up good enough, satisfying, and sufficing actions to perform their goals, even if their is a best way of doing it
*   Changes in midstream: people change their mind and actions while doing things (e.g., shopping). Donâ€™t lock users, instead, it may prove useful to provide users opportunities to pick up other choices.
*   Deferred choices: Easy entry points with bare minimum first, then combe back later (if ever) for more
*   Incremental construction: small atomic steps to perform the work in linear and non-linear manner. Give people opportinuties to start small pieces, pause, setp back, loot at them again, test them, change them.
*   Habituation: People have learned some gestures becoming reflexive actions (e.g., crtrl+s to save etc.). Follow such universal gesutures.
*   Microbreaks: People often find themselves with a few minutes of downtime, they might need mental breaks, etc.. Provide space of microbreaks. A microbeak activity should be very easy and fast (e.g., android phones news)
*   Spatial memory: Many people rely on spatial memory to do perform their actions, (e.g., desktop metaphor). People my find or do things by seeing or remembering where they are. Place elements of the UI in predictable places (e.g., dialog buttons - OK, Cancel, etc.).
*   Prospective memory: We plan to do things in the future and we arrange visuospatial probs (in our environment) to do it. We keep files on the desk to remind us of things to do etc. This is part of how we cope with our complex workflows. We use knowledge in the work to support our memory (i.e., offloading, mind in motion). Memory aids that we typically use are, notes, windows on screen, annotations on documents, bookmarks, tagged files and emails, documents kept open
*   Streamlined repetition: reduces the need to perform the same operation over and over again. Some examples are copy-paste, find, and replace. Another example is Photoshop, where user can record actions, such as resize, crop, color change, and save 20 images. The user records such steps on 1 image and plays them on 19 images.
*   Keyboard: switching between the mouse and keyboard takes time and effort. And some people prefer to keep their hands on the keyboard (e.g., using tab to indent or traverse a tabbed window)
*   Social media, social proof: People are social. We tend to be influenced by what our peers say and do. We are much more likely to watch, read, buy, join, share, comment, or take any actions if we see someone we knowhas recomended it or done it. This is called social proof.
*   collaboration: Productivity and communication software has been transformed by software that allows people separated by space and time to come together in threads, documents reviews, video meeting.
*   beyond screen:
